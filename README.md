<a href="https://himanshu007-creator.github.io/AMZN-1.0.1/">This</a> project aims at studying and improving the <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/">Prime video</a> website, which is an Amazon's subsidiary.

## Findings in existing website
### Pros
1. Website have a decent theme and less/no animations make loading time fast
2. Website fully goes with teh concept of an OTT platform's website , going well with teh dark theme, with a tough of <a href="https://www.schemecolor.com/amazon-prime-blue-logo-color-scheme.php">amazon's iconic blue</a>
3. Website is great in terms of responsivity its really awesome. Things start to get affected after 294px(the signup button begins to snip).

### Cons
> 1. inconsistency of logo :- the logo in header and footer are different. Header have a dull white logo , while fooetr have a blue and white logo, which seems odd.
>  They should be same
> 2. Low contrast :- there is low contrast in the hyperlinks of footer div.
> 3. in div with id=<code>dvm_MLP_IN_Bene_4</code>, the white color does not seem going with the theme.
> 4. ( _Personal suggestion_) Amazon's Smile :- Amazon's iconic smile is missing from the website.

### My improvements/changes
1. Made logo of header and footer consistent
2. Improved the contrast rario of fooetr hyperlinks
3. replaced white background witha  gradient background of amazon's blue with a shade of white ( _spotlight effect_ )
4. Amazon's smile visible <code>2s</code> after website loads.
